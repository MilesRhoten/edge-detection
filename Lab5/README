The first thing i did is changed .at to .data for both grayscale and sobel

Changed from processing topleft topright bottomleft bottomright
to doing 4 horizontal chunks as described in class


Removed floating point math in greyscale function

removed unecessary matrix creation and copy in wrapper function

made it so threads are only made once instead of every frame
